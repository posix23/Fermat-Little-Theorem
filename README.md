# Fermat's Little Theorem

## Introduction
### The theorem was created by Pierre de Fermat on 1640 to verify if a given integer is prime. If $p$ is a prime number and $a$ is not divisible by $p$, then $a^{p-1}-1$ is divisible by $p$.

## Algorithm
### The algorithm aims to verify if a given integer is prime by rejecting every even integer bigger than 2 as defined as $2k$ for $k$ being any integer and even checks if a very large integer outside of JavaScript's max integer is a prime number.
