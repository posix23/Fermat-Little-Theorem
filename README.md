# Fermat's Little Theorem

## Introduction
### The theorem was created by Pierre de Fermat on 1640 to verify if a given integer is prime. If ![\Large p](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;p) is a prime number and $a$ is not divisible by $p$, then $a^{p-1}-1$ is divisible by $p$.

## Algorithm
### The algorithm aims to verify if a given integer is prime by rejecting every even integer bigger than 2 as defined as $2k$ for $k$ being any integer and even checks if a very large integer outside of JavaScript's max integer is a prime number.

![\Large x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a})
